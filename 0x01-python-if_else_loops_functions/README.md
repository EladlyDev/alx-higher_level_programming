# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
The second project in Python where we study if/else, loops, and functions to control the flow.

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/SdBJUMTPS5VW3cQNkhaeSg), **without the help of Google**:

# **General**

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- [How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements)
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How is Python’s `for` different from `C`‘s?

    When it comes to syntax, in C, the do-while loop is similar to the while loop but is written in a different way. It is used to perform iterations when a specified condition is true.

    In contrast, in Python, the for loop is used to iterate through items in an iterable, such as an array, string, etc.

- How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
    In a while loop, it executes when the condition is false.
	    In a for loop, it executes when there are no more items in the set.
		
    It only works if the loop finishes normally and is not forced to terminate using the break statement.
- What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
    It simply does nothing and is used as a placeholder for future code in statements that require some code or will throw an error, such as while, for, if, etc.
- How to use `range`
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
